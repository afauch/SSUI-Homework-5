# Crayon

Crayon is a lightweight, 3D UI prototyping toolkit for Unity. It was made for 3D UI designers who prefer working with GameObjects and TextMeshes over the 2D-oriented Unity GUI Canvas system.

Crayon makes it easier to set states and transitions for the following properties on any GameObject:
+ Opacity
+ Color
+ Position
+ Rotation
+ Scale

## Usage

```c#
using Crayon;
```
Crayon contains several extension methods for the GameObject class, so you don't need to constantly call the Crayon namespace.

### Fade In/Out
Unity can make opacity a pain, but Crayon makes it easy. It doesn't matter if your gameObject is text, sprite, or mesh...
Crayon will figure that out for you. Fades are applied to all children automatically, so you don't have to worry about looping over nested child objects.
```c#
// Fade in over 800ms
gameObject.FadeIn(0.8f);
```
```c#
// Fade with easing
gameObject.FadeIn(0.8f, Easing.Linear);
```
```c#
// Instantiate a new GameObject and fade it in
gameObject.FadeInNew(0.8f);
```
```c#
// Fade Out
gameObject.FadeOut(0.8f);
```
```c#
// Fade Out and Destroy
gameObject.FadeOut(0.8f, true);
```

### Transitions
Crayon gives you simple functions for tweening common properties like color, position, rotation, size, and opacity.

#### Color Transitions
```c#
// Set color without tweening
Color32 red = new Color32(255, 0, 0, 255);
gameObject.SetColor(red);
```
```c#
// Tween to red over 800ms
gameObject.SetColor(red, 0.8f);
```
```c#
// Tween to hex color -
// Crayon will automatically convert to RGBA
gameObject.SetColor("#FF0000", 0.8f);
```
#### Opacity Transitions
```c#
// Tween to 20% opacity over 800ms
gameObject.SetOpacity(0.2f, 0.8f);
```
#### Transform Transitions
```c#
// Tween position to an absolute position in world space
gameObject.SetPosition(new Vector3(9.0f, 9.0f, 9.0f), 0.8f);
```
```c#
// Tween position, relative to current localPosition
gameObject.SetRelativePosition(new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f), 0.8f);
```
```c#
// Tween to rotation
gameObject.SetRotation(new Vector3(9.0f, 9.0f, 9.0f), 0.8f, Easing.Cubic);
```

### States

Crayon also provides Editor components that make it easy to define common states.

```c#
private void OnFocus() { // (Your own interaction method)
  // Switch to hover state
  gameObject.SetState(hover);
}
```
```c#
private void OnLightsDown() { // (Your own interaction method)
  // Switch to a custom state
  gameObject.SetState(LightsDown);
}
```
