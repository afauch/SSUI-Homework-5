# Crayon

Crayon is a lightweight, UI toolkit for Unity, made with 3D UI designers in mind. Crayon is for 3D UI designers who prefer working with GameObjects and TextMeshes over the 2D-oriented Unity GUI Canvas system.

Crayon makes it easier to set states and transitions for the following properties:
+ Opacity
+ Color
+ Position
+ Rotation
+ Scale

## Usage

Crayon contains a number of extension methods for the GameObject class, so you don't need to constantly call the Crayon namespace.
